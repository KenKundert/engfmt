engfmt - Engineering Format
===========================

A light-weight package used to read and write numbers in engineering format. In 
engineering format a number generally includes the units if available and uses 
SI scale factors to indicate the magnitude of the number. For example:

   | 1ns
   | 1.4204GHz

A quantity is the pairing of a real number and units, though the units may be 
empty. This package is designed to convert quantities between the various ways 
in which they are represented.  Those ways are:

As a tuple:
    For example, 1ns would be represented as (1e-9, 's').
    Notice that the scale factor is not included in the units. This is always 
    true.

As a string in conventional formats:
    For example, 1ns would be represented as '1e-9 s' or as '0.000000001s'. This 
    form is often difficult to read for people and so *engfmt* treats it more as 
    a format meant for machines rather than people.

As a string in engineering format:
    For example, 1ns would be represented as '1ns'.  This form is often 
    difficult to read for machines and so *engfmt* treats it more as a human 
    readable format.

The *Quantity* class is provided for converting between these various forms. It 
takes one or two arguments. The first is taken to be the value, and the second, 
if given, is taken to be the units.  The value may be given as a float or as 
a string. The string may be in floating point notation, in scientific notation, 
or in engineering format and may include the units. By engineering notation, it 
is meant that the number can use the SI scale factors. For example, any of the 
following ways can be used to specify 1ns:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from engfmt import Quantity
    >>> period = Quantity(1e-9, 's')
    >>> print(period)
    1ns

    >>> period = Quantity('0.000000001 s')
    >>> print(period)
    1ns

    >>> period = Quantity('1e-9s')
    >>> print(period)
    1ns

    >>> period = Quantity('1ns')
    >>> print(period)
    1ns

In all cases, the giving the units is optional.

From a quantity object, you can generate any representation:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> h_line = Quantity('1420.405751786 MHz')

    >>> h_line.to_tuple()
    (1420405751.786, 'Hz')

    >>> h_line.to_eng()
    '1.4204GHz'

    >>> h_line.to_str()
    '1420.405751786e6Hz'

You can also access the value without the units::

    >>> h_line.to_float()
    1420405751.786

    >>> h_line.to_unitless_eng()
    '1.4204G'

    >>> h_line.to_unitless_str()
    '1420.405751786e6'

Or you can access just the units::

    >>> h_line.units
    'Hz'

The output of the *to_eng* and *to_unitless_eng* methods is always rounded to 
the desired precision, which can be specified as an argument.  This differs from 
the *to_str* and *to_unitless_str* methods. They attempt to retain the original 
format of the number if it is specified as a string. In this way it retains its 
original precision. The underlying assumption behind this difference is that 
engineering notation is generally used when communicating with people, whereas 
floating point notation is used when communicating with machines. People benefit 
from having a limited number of digits in the numbers, whereas machines benefit 
from have full precision numbers.

Shortcut Functions
------------------

Generally one uses the shortcut functions to convert numbers to and from 
engineering format. All of these functions take the value and units in the same 
ways that they are specified to Quantity.  In particular, the value may be 
a string or a real number.  If it is a string it may be given in traditional 
format or in engineering format, and it may include the units.  For example:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from engfmt import quant_to_tuple
   >>> quant_to_tuple('1.4204GHz')
   (1420400000.0, 'Hz')

   >>> from engfmt import quant_to_eng
   >>> quant_to_eng(1420400000.0, 'Hz')
   '1.4204GHz'

   >>> from engfmt import quant_to_sci
   >>> quant_to_sci('1.4204GHz', prec=4)
   '1.4204×10⁰⁹Hz'

   >>> from engfmt import quant_to_str
   >>> quant_to_str(1420400000.0, 'Hz')
   '1.4204e+09Hz'

   >>> from engfmt import quant_to_float
   >>> quant_to_float('1.4204GHz')
   1420400000.0

   >>> from engfmt import quant_to_unitless_str
   >>> quant_to_unitless_str('1.4204GHz')
   '1.4204e9'

   >>> from engfmt import quant_to_unitless_eng
   >>> quant_to_unitless_eng('1.4204e9Hz')
   '1.4204G'

   >>> from engfmt import quant_strip
   >>> quant_strip('1.4204GHz')
   '1.4204G'
   >>> quant_strip('1.4204e9Hz')
   '1.4204e9'


Preferences
-----------

You can adjust some of the behavior of these functions on a global basis using 
*set_preferences*:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from engfmt import set_preferences, quant_to_eng, quant_to_sci
   >>> set_preferences(hprec=2, spacer=' ')
   >>> quant_to_eng('1.4204GHz')
   '1.42 GHz'
   >>> quant_to_eng('1.4204GHz', prec=4)
   '1.4204 GHz'
   >>> quant_to_sci('1.4204GHz', prec=4)
   '1.4204×10⁰⁹ Hz'

Specifying *hprec* (human precision) to be 4 gives 5 digits of precision (you 
get one more digit than the number you specify for precision). Thus, the valid 
range for *prec* is from 0 to around 12 to 14 for double precision numbers.

Passing *None* as a value in *set_preferences* returns that preference to its 
default value:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> set_preferences(hprec=None, spacer=None)
   >>> quant_to_eng('1.4204GHz')
   '1.4204GHz'

The available preferences are:

hprec (int):
    Human precision in digits where 0 corresponds to 1 digit, must
    be nonnegative. This precision is used when generating engineering
    format.

mprec (int):
    Machine precision in digits where 0 corresponds to 1 digit.
    Must be nonnegative. This precision is used when not generating
    engineering format.

spacer (str):
    May be '' or ' ', use the latter if you prefer a space between
    the number and the units. Generally using ' ' makes numbers easier to
    read, particularly with complex units, and using '' is easier to parse.

unity (str):
    The output scale factor for unity, generally '' or '_'.

output (str):
    Which scale factors to output, generally one would only use familiar scale 
    factors.

ignore_sf (bool):
    Whether scale factors should be ignored by default.

assign_fmt (str):
    Format string for an assignment. Will be passed through string format 
    method.  Format string takes three possible arguments named n,
    q, and d for the name, value and description.  The default is '{n} = {v}'

assign_rec (str):
    Regular expression used to recognize an assignment. Used in 
    add_to_namespace(). Default recognizes the form:

        "Temp = 300_K -- Temperature".


Quantity Class
--------------

Though rarely used directly, the Quantity class forms the foundation of the 
*engfmt* package. It is more flexible than the shortcut functions:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from engfmt import Quantity
   >>> h_line = Quantity('1420.405751786 MHz')

   >>> str(h_line)
   '1.4204GHz'

   >>> float(h_line)
   1420405751.786

   >>> h_line.to_tuple()
   (1420405751.786, 'Hz')

   >>> h_line.to_eng(7)
   '1.4204058GHz'

   >>> h_line.to_sci()
   '1.4204×10⁰⁹Hz'

   >>> h_line.to_str()
   '1420.405751786e6Hz'

   >>> h_line.to_float()
   1420405751.786

   >>> h_line.to_unitless_eng(4)
   '1.4204G'

   >>> h_line.to_unitless_str()
   '1420.405751786e6'

   >>> h_line.strip()
   '1420.405751786M'

   >>> h_line.units
   'Hz'

   >>> h_line.add_name('Fhy')
   >>> h_line.name
   'Fhy'

   >>> h_line.add_desc('frequency of hydrogen line')
   >>> h_line.desc
   'frequency of hydrogen line'

   >>> h_line.is_infinite()
   False

   >>> h_line.is_nan()
   False


Physical Constants
------------------

The Quantity class also supports a small number of physical constants.

Plank's constant:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> plank = Quantity('h')
   >>> print(plank)
   662.61e-36J-s

Boltzmann's constant:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> boltz = Quantity('k')
   >>> print(boltz)
   13.806e-24J/K

Elementary charge:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> q = Quantity('q')
   >>> print(q)
   160.22e-21C

Speed of light:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> c = Quantity('c')
   >>> print(c)
   299.79Mm/s

Zero degrees Celsius in Kelvin:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> zeroC = Quantity('C0')
   >>> print(zeroC)
   273.15K

*engfmt* uses *k* rather than *K* to represent kilo so that you can distinguish 
between kilo and Kelvin.

Permittivity of free space:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> eps0 = Quantity('eps0')
   >>> print(eps0)
   8.8542pF/m

Permeability of free space:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> mu0 = Quantity('mu0')
   >>> print(mu0)
   1.2566uH/m

Characteristic impedance of free space:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> Z0 = Quantity('Z0')
   >>> print(Z0)
   376.73Ohms

You can add additional constants by adding them to the CONSTANTS dictionary:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from engfmt import Quantity, CONSTANTS
   >>> CONSTANTS['h_line'] = (1.420405751786e9, 'Hz')
   >>> h_line = Quantity('h_line')
   >>> print(h_line)
   1.4204GHz


String Formatting
-----------------

Quantities can be passed into the string *format* method:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> print('{}'.format(h_line))
   1.4204GHz

You can specify the precision as part of the format specification

.. code-block:: python

   >>> print('{:.6}'.format(h_line))
   1.420406GHz

The 'q' type specifier can be used to explicitly indicate that both the number 
and the units are desired:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> print('{:.6q}'.format(h_line))
   1.420406GHz

Alternately, 'r' can be used to indicate just the number is desired:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> print('{:r}'.format(h_line))
   1.4204G

Use 'u' to indicate that only the units are desired:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> print('{:u}'.format(h_line))
   Hz

You can also use the string and floating point format type specifiers:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> print('{:f}'.format(h_line))
   1420405751.786000

   >>> print('{:e}'.format(h_line))
   1.420406e+09

   >>> print('{:g}'.format(h_line))
   1.42041e+09

   >>> print('{:s}'.format(h_line))
   1.4204GHz

It is also possible to add a name and perhaps a description to the quantity, and 
access those with special format codes as well:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> h_line.add_name('Fhy')
   >>> h_line.add_desc('frequency of hydrogen line')
   >>> print('{:n}'.format(h_line))
   Fhy

   >>> print('{:d}'.format(h_line))
   frequency of hydrogen line

   >>> print('{:Q}'.format(h_line))
   Fhy = 1.4204GHz

   >>> print('{:R}'.format(h_line))
   Fhy = 1.4204G

   >>> print('{0:Q} ({0:d})'.format(h_line))
   Fhy = 1.4204GHz (frequency of hydrogen line)


Exceptions
----------

A ValueError is raised if engfmt is passed a string it cannot convert into 
a number:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> try:
   ...     value, units = quant_to_tuple('xxx')
   ... except ValueError as err:
   ...     print(err)
   xxx: not a valid number.


Text Processing
---------------

Two functions are available for converting quantities embedded within text to 
and from engineering notation:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from engfmt import all_to_eng_fmt, all_from_eng_fmt
   >>> all_to_eng_fmt('The frequency of the hydrogen line is 1420405751.786Hz.')
   'The frequency of the hydrogen line is 1.4204GHz.'

   >>> all_from_eng_fmt('The frequency of the hydrogen line is 1.4204GHz.')
   'The frequency of the hydrogen line is 1.4204e9Hz.'


Add to Namespace
----------------

It is possible to put a collection of quantities in a text string and then use 
the *add_to_namespace* function to parse the quantities and add them to the 
Python namespace. For example:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from engfmt import add_to_namespace

   >>> design_parameters = '''
   ...     Fref = 156 MHz  -- Reference frequency
   ...     Kdet = 88.3 uA  -- Gain of phase detector (Imax)
   ...     Kvco = 9.07 GHz/V  -- Gain of VCO
   ... '''
   >>> add_to_namespace(design_parameters)

   >>> print(Fref, Kdet, Kvco, sep='\n')
   156MHz
   88.3uA
   9.07GHz/V

Any number of quantities may be given, with each quantity given on its own line.  
The identifier given to the left '=' is the name of the variable in the local 
namespace that is used to hold the quantity. The text after the '--' is used as 
a description of the quantity.


Scale Factors and Units
-----------------------

By default, *engfmt* treats both the scale factor and the units as being 
optional. With the scale factor being optional, the meaning of some 
specifications can be ambiguous. For example, '1m' may represent 1 milli or it 
may represent 1 meter.  Similarly, '1meter' my represent 1 meter or 
1 milli-eter. To allow you to avoid this ambiguity, *engfmt* accepts '_' as the 
unity scale factor. In this way '1_m' is unambiguously 1 meter. You can instruct 
*engfmt* to output '_' as the unity scale factor by specifying the *unity* 
argument to *set_preferences*:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from engfmt import set_preferences, Quantity
   >>> set_preferences(unity='_')
   >>> l = Quantity(1, 'm')
   >>> print(l)
   1_m

If you need to interpret numbers that have units and are known not to have scale 
factors, you can specify the *ignore_sf* preference:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> set_preferences(ignore_sf=True, unity='')
   >>> l = Quantity('1000m')
   >>> l.to_tuple()
   (1000.0, 'm')

   >>> print(l)
   1km


Installation
------------

Use 'pip install engfmt' to install. Requires Python2.7 or Python3.3 or better.
